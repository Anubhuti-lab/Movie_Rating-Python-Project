# Movie_Rating-Python-Project
Movie Rating Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes a movie ratings dataset to extract insights about user preferences and rating patterns. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project explores the distribution of ratings and provides analytical methods to understand movie popularity and user behavior.
Dataset
The dataset contains movie ratings information with the following key columns:

movieId: Unique identifier for each movie
Ratings: Numerical ratings given by users (scale of 0.5-5.0)
userId: Unique identifier for each user

Features

Exploratory data analysis of movie ratings distribution
Grouping and aggregation by movie, rating, and user
Visualization of rating patterns and trends
Statistical analysis of rating behaviors

Technologies Used

Python 3
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib/Pyplot for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Key Findings

Most movies receive ratings in the 3-5 range, with the highest concentration at rating 4
The distribution shows strong positive skew with fewer low ratings (0.5-2)
Clear rating preference peaks can be observed at whole numbers (3, 4, 5)
